written by Zichang Guo.

Here is a list of files:
1. Java files: (Complex.java FFT.java InputAndMatch.java MainFunction.java ReadAudio.java Spectrogram.java)
2. ProjectReport.doc
3. Samples(3 audio files and 1 named Clip.wav which is recorded version of Boom Clap.wav)
Note£º because the size of wav file, I only put 2 audio tracks in sample folder.
